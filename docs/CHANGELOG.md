  - `cli/` - Command-line interface

- **Security Features**:
  - `--from-lrc` - LRC (License and Regulatory Compliance) metadata integration
  - `--sign` - GPG artifact signing for report integrity
  - Encrypted audit logging to `~/.config/dat/auditlog.jsonl`
  - Path traversal protection and file validation

- **Scanning Modes**:
  - `--safe/--no-safe` - Safe scanning mode with configurable limits
  - `--deep` - Deep scan including binary files and no size limits
  - `--max-lines` and `--max-size` - Configurable resource limits

- **Reporting System**:
  - `--report` - Unified report generation with format auto-detection

  - Automatic `.lrc-audit.json` emission with scan results
  - Compliance framework support (SOC2, GDPR, HIPAA)
  - Custom rule engine with severity levels

- **CLI Enhancements**:
  - `--diff` - Compare current scan with previous JSON report
  - `--verbose` - Detailed progress and debug information
  - `--interactive` - Confirmation prompts for sensitive operations
  - File selection options: `-f/--folder`, `-s/--single-file`, `-a/--all`
